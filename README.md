# Grid Coloring (by ChatGPT3)

This README file, along with the HTML, CSS, and JavaScript code powering the Grid Coloring web page, was generated entirely by ChatGPT3 using natural language processing.

## Usage

To use the Grid Coloring page, follow these steps:

1. Enter the colors you want to use in the textarea. You can separate the colors by spaces or commas.
2. The grid will update automatically with the colors you entered.
3. Hover over a cell to reveal a copy button that allows you to copy the color code of the cell.
4. If you want to change the colors of the grid, update the colors in the textarea and the grid will update automatically.

## Technology

This site was created solely using ChatGPT3 without any manual modifications. The HTML, CSS, and JavaScript were generated entirely using natural language processing, and the site is fully functional in modern web browsers.

## Future Plans

We plan to add the ability to customize the size of the grid and to add additional features, such as the ability to export the grid as an image or to save and load grids. Stay tuned for updates!
